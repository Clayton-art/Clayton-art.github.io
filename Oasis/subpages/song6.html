    <p class="p2">I need to be myself</p>
    <p class="p2">I can't be no one else</p>
    <p class="p2">I'm feeling supersonic</p>
    <p class="p2">Give me gin and tonic</p>
    <p class="p2">You can have it all but how much do you want it?</p>
    <p class="p2">You make me laugh</p>
    <p class="p2">Give me your autograph</p>
    <p class="p2">Can I ride with you in your BMW?</p>
    <p class="p2">You can sail with me in my yellow submarine</p>
    <p class="p2">You need to find out</p>
    <p class="p2">'Cause no one's gonna tell you what I'm on about</p>
    <p class="p2">You need to find a way for what you want to say</p>
    <p class="p2">But before tomorrow</p>
    <p class="p2">'Cause my friend said he'd take you home</p>
    <p class="p2">He sits in a corner all alone</p>
    <p class="p2">He lives under a waterfall</p>
    <p class="p2">Nobody can see him</p>
    <p class="p2">Nobody can ever hear him call</p>
    <p class="p2">Nobody can ever hear him call</p>
    <p class="p2">(Ah, ah-ah)</p>
    <p class="p2">You need to be yourself</p>
    <p class="p2">You can't be no one else</p>
    <p class="p2">I know a girl called Elsa, she's into Alka-Seltzer</p>
    <p class="p2">She sniffs it through a cane on a supersonic train</p>
    <p class="p2">And She made me laugh</p>
    <p class="p2">I got her autograph</p>
    <p class="p2">She done it with a doctor on a helicopter</p>
    <p class="p2">She's sniffing in a tissue, selling the Big Issue</p>
    <p class="p2">When she finds out</p>
    <p class="p2">No one's gonna tell you what I'm on about</p>
    <p class="p2">You need to find a way for what you want to say</p>
    <p class="p2">But before tomorrow</p>
    <p class="p2">'Cause my friend said he'd take you home</p>
    <p class="p2">He sits in a corner all alone</p>
    <p class="p2">He lives under a waterfall</p>
    <p class="p2">Nobody can see him</p>
    <p class="p2">Nobody can ever hear him call</p>
