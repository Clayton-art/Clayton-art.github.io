    <p class="p2">Slide away and give it all you've got</p>
    <p class="p2">My today fell in from the top</p>
    <p class="p2">I dream of you and all the things you say</p>
    <p class="p2">I wonder where you are now</p>
    <p class="p2">Hold me down, all the world's asleep</p>
    <p class="p2">Need you now, you've knocked me off my feet</p>
    <p class="p2">I dream of you and we talk of growing old</p>
    <p class="p2">But you said, "Please don't"</p>
    <p class="p2">Slide away, to give it all you've got</p>
    <p class="p2">I've tried praying</p>
    <p class="p2">But I don't know what you're saying to me</p>
    <p class="p2">Now that you're mine</p>
    <p class="p2">We'll find a way of chasing the Sun</p>
    <p class="p2">Let me be the one who shines with you</p>
    <p class="p2">In the morning, we don't know what to do</p>
    <p class="p2">Two of a kind</p>
    <p class="p2">We'll find a way to do what we've done</p>
    <p class="p2">Let me be the one who shines with you</p>
    <p class="p2">And we can slide away</p>
    <p class="p2">Slide away,Slide away, Away</p>
    <p class="p2">Slide away and give it all you've got</p>
    <p class="p2">My today fell in from the top</p>
    <p class="p2">I dream of you and all the things you say</p>
    <p class="p2">I wonder where you are now</p>
    <p class="p2">Slide in baby, together we'll fly</p>
    <p class="p2">I've tried praying</p>
    <p class="p2">But I don't know what you're saying to me</p>
    <p class="p2">Now that you're mine</p>
    <p class="p2">We'll find a way of chasing the Sun</p>
    <p class="p2">Let me be the one who shines with you</p>

    <p class="p2">Two of a kind</p>
    <p class="p2">We'll find a way to do what we've done</p>
    <p class="p2">Oh, Let me be the one who shines with you</p>
    <p class="p2">And we can slide away</p>
    <p class="p2">Slide away, Slide away, Slide away</p>
