    <h1 class="head1">Dont look back in anger</h1>
    <h2 class="head2">aosis</h2>
    <p class="par1">Slip inside the eye of your mind
    Don't you know you might find
    A better place to play?
    You said that you'd never been
    But all the things that you've seen
    Will slowly fade away</p>

    <p class="par2">So I start a revolution from my bed
    'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
    Step outside, summertime's in bloom
    Stand up beside the fireplace
    Take that look from off your face
    You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out
    </p>
    <p class="par3">And so, Sally can wait
    She knows it's too late as we're walkin' on by
    Her soul slides away
    "But don't look back in anger," I heard you say
    </p>
    <p class="par4">Take me to the place where you go
    Where nobody knows
    If it's night or day
    Please don't put your life in the hands
    Of a rock 'n' roll band
    Who'll throw it all away</p>

    <p class="par5">I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed
    'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
    Step outside, summertime's in bloom
    Stand up beside the fireplace
    Take that look from off your face
    You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out</p>

    <p class="par6">And so, Sally can wait
    She knows it's too late as we're walkin' on by
    Her soul slides away
    But don't look back in anger
    I heard you say</p>
    <p class="par7">So Sally can wait
    She knows it's too late as we're walkin' on by
    Her soul slides away
    But don't look back in anger
    I heard you say
    At least not today</p>
