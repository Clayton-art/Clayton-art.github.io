    <p class="p2">Slip inside the eye of your mind</p>
    <p class="p2">Don't you know you might find</p>
    <p class="p2">A better place to play?</p>
    <p class="p2">You said that you'd never been</p>
    <p class="p2">But all the things that you've seen</p>
    <p class="p2">Will slowly fade away</p>
    <p class="p2">So I start a revolution from my bed</p>
    <p class="p2">'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head</p>
    <p class="p2">Step outside, summertime's in bloom</p>
    <p class="p2">Stand up beside the fireplace</p>
    <p class="p2">Take that look from off your face</p>
    <p class="p2">You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out</p>
    <p class="p2">And so, Sally can wait</p>
    <p class="p2">She knows it's too late as we're walkin' on by</p>
    <p class="p2">Her soul slides away</p>
    <p class="p2">"But don't look back in anger," I heard you say</p>
    <p class="p2">Take me to the place where you go</p>
    <p class="p2">Where nobody knows</p>
    <p class="p2">If it's night or day</p>
    <p class="p2">Please don't put your life in the hands</p>
    <p class="p2">Of a rock 'n' roll band</p>
    <p class="p2">Who'll throw it all away</p>
    <p class="p2">I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed</p>
    <p class="p2">'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head</p>
    <p class="p2">Step outside, 'cause summertime's in bloom</p>
    <p class="p2">Stand up beside the fireplace</p>
    <p class="p2">Take that look from off your face</p>
    <p class="p2">'Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out</p>
    <p class="p2">And so, Sally can wait</p>
    <p class="p2">She knows it's too late as she's walking on by</p>

    <p class="p2">"At least not today"</p>
